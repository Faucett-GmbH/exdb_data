    description: |
      The barbell pullover is old-school iron therapy — part stretch, part contraction, all gain. Lying flat on a bench, you lower the bar behind your head and pull it back over, stretching the lats and pecs in one long, controlled arc. It’s a forgotten classic that targets the upper body in a unique way — bridging the chest and back in a single, fluid movement. Breathe deep and move smooth.
    summary: |
      The barbell pullover is a hybrid chest and lat exercise performed lying on a bench, pulling the barbell from above the chest to behind the head.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Lie flat on a bench, feet planted. Hold a barbell with a narrow, overhand grip above the chest.
      2. Brace: Keep arms slightly bent and locked in that position throughout.
      3. Lower: Slowly arc the bar behind your head, lowering it until you feel a deep stretch in the lats and chest.
      4. Pull: Reverse the motion, pulling the bar back over to the starting position.
      5. Repeat: Keep the motion smooth and controlled, no jerking.
    tips:
      - Don’t overbend the elbows — keep the arms fixed.
      - Great for expanding the ribcage and thoracic mobility.
      - Use light to moderate weight with high focus on feel.
