    description: |
      The continental clean and press is not pretty — it’s effective. Used in strongman to lift thick bars or axle bars too awkward to clean with traditional technique, it’s a grind. You pull the bar to your belly, reset, then muscle it to your shoulders. From there, you press, push press, or jerk it overhead. It’s all hips, traps, and violence. If the Olympic clean is ballet, the continental is barroom brawling.
    summary: |
      The barbell continental clean and press is a strongman-style lift using a mixed, dirty technique to get the bar to the shoulders, then pressing it overhead with brute force.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Feet hip-width, bar over midfoot, mixed grip or straps often used.
      2. First Pull: Deadlift the bar to the upper thigh or belly area.
      3. Lap the Bar: Rest it on the belly or belt, regrip.
      4. Second Pull: Clean the bar to the shoulders (front rack), using a roll and hip pop if needed.
      5. Press: Strict press, push press, or push jerk the bar overhead.
      6. Lockout: Arms extended, bar overhead with control.
      7. Lower: Return bar to rack or belly, then reset.
    tips:
      - Wearing a belt helps — it gives the bar a shelf to rest on.
      - Expect bruises. This is not a clean clean.
      - Try a mixed grip — the pull is awkward and heavy.
      - Perfect for axle bar work or building brute strength.
