    description: |
      The barbell snatch pull is where you learn to move heavy things fast — without having to catch them. It reinforces the first and second pulls of the snatch, teaches patience off the floor, and demands aggression at the top. You finish with a violent triple extension and shrug, driving the bar as high as possible without flipping under it. If your traps aren’t fried, you didn’t pull hard enough.
    summary: |
      The snatch pull is a snatch assistance exercise that builds explosive power and strength by pulling the barbell from the floor to the upper torso without completing the catch.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Feet hip-width, snatch-width grip, chest up, shoulders over the bar.
      2. First Pull: Push the floor away, bar rises controlled past the knees.
      3. Transition: Re-bend knees, hips shift forward under the bar.
      4. Second Pull: Extend hips, knees, and ankles powerfully — triple extension.
      5. Shrug: Pull the shoulders up violently, elbows high.
      6. Finish: Bar rises to chest or higher — stay tall, don’t pull under.
      7. Reset: Lower with control, repeat.
    tips:
      - Stay over the bar. Don’t rush the second pull.
      - Bar stays close — if it drifts, your pull is weak.
      - Great for reinforcing bar path and explosive extension.
      - Load heavier than your max snatch for strength adaptation.
