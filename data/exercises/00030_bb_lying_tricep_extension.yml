    description: |
      The lying tricep extension is the triceps’ version of an ambush — controlled descent to your forehead, then a violent extension back to lockout. It’s a simple, savage way to forge triceps that don’t quit. Whether you want a bigger bench or just want to fill out your sleeves, this is the direct hit your arms need. Control the eccentric, own the concentric, and don’t crush your skull.
    summary: |
      The barbell lying tricep extension, or skull crusher, isolates the triceps by extending the arms while lying on a bench, driving the bar from forehead to lockout.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Lie on a flat bench. Grip the barbell with hands shoulder-width, arms extended over chest.
      2. Lower: Bend elbows to lower the bar to just above the forehead or hairline. Keep upper arms fixed.
      3. Stretch: Feel the deep stretch in the triceps at the bottom.
      4. Extend: Press the bar back to starting position by extending the elbows.
      5. Lockout: Fully extend but don’t hyperextend the elbows.
      6. Repeat: Maintain control, don’t let the bar drift.
    tips:
      - Keep elbows from flaring out — locked position means triceps work.
      - Control the descent
