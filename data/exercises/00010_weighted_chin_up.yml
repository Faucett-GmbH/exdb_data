    summary: |
      Pull yourself up to the bar with added weight hanging from your waist. A brutal upper-body strength builder.
    description: |
      The weighted chin-up is a foundational upper-body strength exercise. It targets the biceps, lats, and upper back through vertical pulling. By adding external load, the movement becomes a serious test of relative and absolute strength. It is not for the beginner—it is a rite of passage. Chin-ups with weight forge real pulling power and dense upper-body muscle. Use a dip belt or load a dumbbell between your feet—then get to work.
    instructions: |
      1. Secure a weight plate or dumbbell using a dip belt or hold it between your feet or knees.
      2. Grab the bar with a supinated (underhand) grip, shoulder-width apart.
      3. Start from a dead hang with straight arms and scapulae set tight.
      4. Pull your chest to the bar by driving your elbows down and back.
      5. Keep the body tight—no swinging, no kipping.
      6. Pause briefly with your chin over the bar.
      7. Lower yourself under control to a full hang. That’s one rep.
      8. Repeat for the desired number of reps.
    tips:
      - Start with bodyweight chin-ups until you can knock out clean sets of 10–12.
      - Don’t cheat the range—chin over the bar, arms locked at the bottom. No upward swinging using your momentum to propel you up.
      - Breathe at the bottom. Tighten up before each rep.
      - Weighted chin-ups are best done early in your session when fresh.
