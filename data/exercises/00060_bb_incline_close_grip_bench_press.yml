    description: |
      The incline close-grip bench is a brutal hybrid. The incline hits the upper pecs and shoulders, while the narrow grip shifts the load to the triceps. It’s strict, controlled, and demands tight form — no bounce, no flop, just pressing steel with power. A favorite for building overhead strength, triceps thickness, and clean lockout mechanics. If your standard bench feels stale, this one humbles fast.
    summary: |
      The incline close-grip bench press targets the upper chest, triceps, and front delts by pressing a barbell from an inclined bench with a narrow grip.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Set a bench to a 30–45° incline. Lie back and take a grip just inside shoulder-width.
      2. Unrack: Lift the bar and position it over your upper chest.
      3. Lower: Bring the bar down to the upper chest or collarbone area, elbows tucked.
      4. Pause: Brief pause just above the chest — no bounce.
      5. Press: Drive the bar upward, focusing on triceps and upper chest engagement.
      6. Repeat: Keep tight, repeat with control.
    tips:
      - Tuck elbows to protect shoulders and emphasize triceps.
      - Keep wrists stacked over elbows for max transfer.
      - Incline angle affects emphasis — steeper hits delts harder, shallower hits pecs more.
