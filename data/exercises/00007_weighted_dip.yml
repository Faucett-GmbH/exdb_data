    summary: |
      A brutal upper-body builder. Strap on weight, grab parallel bars, lower under control, then drive back up. Hits the chest, shoulders, and triceps hard. If you want serious pressing power and mass, dips need to be in your arsenal.
    description: |
      The weighted dip is the upper-body squat—simple, effective, and unforgiving. It builds serious pressing strength, punishing weak triceps and forging thick chest and shoulder muscles. Strap on weight using a dip belt or hold a dumbbell between your legs. Grab the bars, lower yourself under control until your shoulders dip just below your elbows, then power back up. Keep it strict. No half-rep nonsense.
    instructions: |
      1. Strap on weight using a dip belt or hold a dumbbell between your feet.
      2. Grab the parallel bars with a firm grip, arms locked out, and feet off the ground.
      3. Lean slightly forward for chest emphasis, stay upright for more triceps focus.
      4. Lower yourself under control until your upper arms are at least parallel to the floor.
      5. Drive up hard, locking out at the top without shrugging.
      6. Repeat for reps, maintaining strict form.
    tips:
      - Don’t bounce out of the bottom—control every inch.
      - Elbows should track naturally, not flare out excessively.
      - Keep the core tight—no loose, floppy reps.
      - More forward lean = more chest; staying upright = more triceps.
      - Start with bodyweight before adding load. Heavy dips done wrong can wreck your shoulders.
