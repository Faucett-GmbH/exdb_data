    description: |
      The rack pull is deadlifting without the hardest part. By starting from the knees or mid-shin, you shorten the range of motion and overload the top of the pull. It’s brutal for traps, glutes, and back thickness. If your deadlift stalls near lockout or your traps look like a disappointment, rack pulls are your fix. Go heavy, stay tight, and pull with intent — not momentum.
    summary: |
      The rack pull is a deadlift partial starting from elevated pins or blocks, emphasizing lockout strength and the upper posterior chain.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Barbell set on pins or blocks just below or above the knees. Grip just outside the legs.
      2. Brace: Core tight, back locked in.
      3. Pull: Push through the floor, drive hips forward to stand tall.
      4. Lockout: Fully extend hips and shoulders back.
      5. Lower: Return to the starting position under control.
      6. Repeat: Every rep starts dead — no bouncing.
    tips:
      - Go heavy, but stay strict. Rounding ruins the point.
      - Position the bar where your weakness starts.
      - Use straps to bypass grip fatigue — this is a mass builder.
