    description: |
      The low bar squat is the powerlifter’s go-to — more hips, more weight, less knee travel. By placing the bar just below the spine of the scapula, the lift becomes a levered machine: hips back, chest down, hamstrings tight. It’s not as upright as the high bar, but it lets you move serious weight by turning your backside into a piston. More glutes, more hamstrings, and more force.
    summary: |
      The barbell low bar squat is a compound lift with the bar resting lower on the back, emphasizing posterior chain strength and maximizing hip drive.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Bar sits across the rear delts just below the traps. Hands close, elbows down and back.
      2. Unrack: Step back with feet shoulder-width, toes slightly out.
      3. Brace: Big breath into the belly, squeeze the back tight.
      4. Descend: Hips break first, sit back and down, knees track out.
      5. Bottom: Go below parallel — hip crease below top of knee.
      6. Ascent: Drive hips straight up, chest follows.
      7. Repeat: Reset, brace, squat.
    tips:
      - Keep the back angle consistent — don’t let the chest collapse.
      - Think “hips up,” not “chest up” on the ascent.
      - Build tension in the hamstrings — they do the work.
