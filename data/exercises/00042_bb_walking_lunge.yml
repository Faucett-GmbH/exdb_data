    description: |
      The walking lunge with a barbell is a punishing test of leg strength, coordination, and endurance. You carry the bar on your back and stride forward, one deep lunge at a time. Every step forces the quads, glutes, and hamstrings to work overtime while your core stabilizes the load. It’s not just a leg builder — it’s a humility builder. If your legs don’t burn, you’re not going deep enough.
    summary: |
      The barbell walking lunge is a dynamic, unilateral leg exercise where you lunge forward step by step with a barbell on your back, challenging the quads, glutes, and balance.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Barbell on the back rack position. Stand tall, feet together.
      2. Step: Take a long step forward with one leg.
      3. Descend: Lower your back knee close to the ground, front thigh parallel.
      4. Drive: Push through the front foot to bring the back foot forward into the next lunge.
      5. Repeat: Continue alternating legs for reps or distance.
      6. Maintain Form: Keep torso upright, core tight.
    tips:
      - Don’t rush — control every step.
      - Focus on depth — back knee should nearly kiss the floor.
      - Use lighter weight than squats — the balance challenge is real.
      - Solid for hypertrophy or athletic conditioning.
