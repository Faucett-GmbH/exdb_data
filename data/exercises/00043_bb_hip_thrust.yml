    description: |
      The hip thrust is the glute builder par excellence. You wedge your shoulders onto a bench, roll the bar over your hips, and drive them skyward like your reputation depends on it. Glutes do the lifting; hamstrings and core keep you honest. This is a hip extension powerhouse, ideal for athletes and anyone chasing posterior chain dominance. Half-hearted thrusts are wasted reps — lock out with intent.
    summary: |
      The barbell hip thrust builds glute strength and size by thrusting the hips upward with a barbell across the hips while shoulders rest on a bench.
    instructions:
      1. Setup: Sit on the floor with a barbell rolled over the hips. Upper back against a bench.
      2. Position: Feet flat, knees bent ~90 degrees.
      3. Brace: Tuck the chin slightly, engage the core.
      4. Thrust: Drive through the heels, extend hips upward until torso is parallel to the floor.
      5. Squeeze: Contract glutes hard at the top.
      6. Lower: Lower hips back to the starting position under control.
      7. Repeat: Stay tight and repeat.
    tips:
      - Use a pad or towel to protect the hips from the bar.
      - Feet placement matters - too far forward shifts load to hamstrings.
      - Lock out fully at the top — don’t shortchange the glutes.
