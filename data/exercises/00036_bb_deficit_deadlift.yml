    description: |
      The deficit deadlift is a brutal, no-excuses variation designed to crush weakness off the floor. Standing on a platform or plate, you lengthen the pull, forcing more leg drive, posterior chain engagement, and grit. The bar feels farther away — because it is. If your deadlift stalls off the ground, this is your medicine. Don’t cheat the depth. Don’t round the back - pull straight through.
    summary: |
      The barbell deficit deadlift increases range of motion and builds off-the-floor strength by deadlifting while standing on an elevated surface.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Stand on a platform 1–3 inches tall. Feet hip-width, bar over midfoot, grip just outside knees.
      2. Brace: Engage the core, pull the slack out of the bar.
      3. Pull: Push through the floor, keeping hips and chest rising together.
      4. Lockout: Stand tall at the top — hips through, shoulders back.
      5. Lower: Control the descent to the floor.
      6. Repeat: Maintain tightness each rep.
    tips:
      - Start with a small deficit (1 inch) before going higher.
      - Don’t sacrifice back position for depth.
      - Great for building quad strength and improving start position.
      - Use straps if grip fails — this is a strength builder, not a grip test.
