    description: |
      The T-bar row is a meat-and-potatoes back builder. It locks your torso in place and lets your lats, traps, and rhomboids do the work. Using a landmine or a barbell jammed in a corner, you load plates on one end and pull with both hands on a V-handle. It's heavy, strict, and efficient. Forget the flair — pull hard, squeeze at the top, and let your back grow dense like armor.
    summary: |
      The barbell T-bar row is a compound pulling exercise using a landmine or V-handle to target the lats, rhomboids, traps, and rear delts with a neutral grip.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Anchor one end of a barbell in a landmine or corner. Load weight on the free end.
      2. Handle: Straddle the bar and attach a V-handle under the loaded end.
      3. Position: Hinge at the hips until your torso is 45° to the floor, arms fully extended.
      4. Row: Pull the bar to your chest or lower ribs by squeezing the shoulder blades together.
      5. Squeeze: Pause briefly at the top.
      6. Lower: Lower the bar under control until arms are extended again.
      7. Repeat: Reset posture and continue for reps.
    tips:
      - Keep your torso still — no jerking or heaving.
      - Focus on pulling with the back, not the arms.
      - If your grip fails before your back, use straps.
      - Adjust torso angle for more lat (more parallel) or trap (more upright) emphasis.
