    summary: |
      The king of speed and precision. Rip the bar from the floor, punch it overhead in one fluid motion. Full-body explosion—hips, legs, back, shoulders, and arms all firing. Master it, and you’ll move like an athlete and lift like a beast.
    description: |
      The snatch is the ultimate expression of power, speed, and mobility. It takes the bar from the ground to overhead in a single movement—no hesitation, no second chances. It demands strength, technique, and courage. Done right, it feels effortless. Done wrong, it will humble you. The bar path is tight, the pull is aggressive, and the finish is rock solid. If you’re slow, weak, or out of position, the bar will punish you. But if you respect it, the snatch will forge an athlete out of you.
    instructions: |
      1. Set up with feet under the bar, just outside hip width.
      2. Grip the bar wide—outside shoulder width—using a hook grip.
      3. Set your back tight, chest up, and hips slightly above the knees.
      4. Push the floor away with your legs, keeping the bar close as it moves up.
      5. Once past the knees, explode—extend the hips and pull aggressively.
      6. As the bar reaches peak height, drop under it fast, catching it in a deep squat.
      7. Stabilize with locked arms overhead, stand up strong.
      8. Reset, repeat, and refine—precision is key.
    tips:
      - Stay tight—loose positions kill the lift.
      - Speed under the bar—pull hard, but dive under harder.
      - Bar path matters—keep it close, no looping out front.
      - Wrists and shoulders need mobility—if they suck, fix them first.
      - Start light—chasing PRs before technique is locked in leads to disaster.
