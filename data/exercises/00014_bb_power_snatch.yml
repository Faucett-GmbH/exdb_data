    summary: |
      The power snatch is an explosive Olympic lift where the barbell is pulled from the floor and received overhead in one swift motion, caught in a partial squat.
    description: |
      The power snatch builds speed, coordination, and raw power. It demands commitment. Unlike the full snatch, you catch the bar higher — above parallel — making it accessible but still brutal. You rip the bar from the floor, explode through extension, and punch it overhead before gravity catches up. It’s not a bodybuilding curl. It’s a full-body assault on mediocrity.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Stand with feet hip-width apart. Grip the bar with a wide hook grip — snatch-width — overhand. Shoulders over the bar, chest up, back tight.
      2. First Pull: Drive through the floor with your legs. Bar rises slowly, chest stays ahead of the bar.
      3. Transition (Scoop): As the bar clears the knees, shift knees forward slightly under the bar, re-bend hips.
      4. Second Pull: Explode upward — hips, knees, and ankles extend violently. Shrug hard. Keep the bar close.
      5. Turnover: Pull yourself under the bar fast. Arms punch up as you drop into a quarter squat.
      6. Catch: Stabilize the bar overhead with locked elbows. Feet land flat and solid.
      7. Stand: Drive up to full extension. Control the bar overhead before resetting.
    tips:
      - Speed under the bar is non-negotiable.
      - If it’s floating away from you, you’re not staying over it long enough.
      - Warm-up with overhead squats and snatch pulls to groove mechanics.
      - Record yourself. Bad habits sneak in quietly and ruin your bar path.
      - This is a speed lift. Use submaximal loads with maximal intent.
