    description: |
      The barbell shrug is simple: pick up a heavy bar and pull your shoulders to your ears. That’s it. But do it right, and you’ll build traps that look like a yoke of oxen lives on your back. No jerking, no rolling — just pure vertical shrugging under load. If your traps don’t ache, the bar wasn’t heavy enough.
    summary: |
      The barbell shrug isolates the traps by elevating the shoulders straight up while holding a heavy barbell at arm’s length.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Stand tall, feet hip-width, barbell in hands with overhand grip, arms extended.
      2. Brace: Core tight, chest up.
      3. Shrug: Pull shoulders straight up as high as possible — no rotation.
      4. Squeeze: Hold the top position briefly, squeezing the traps.
      5. Lower: Control the descent back to the start.
      6. Repeat: Keep reps strict and controlled.
    tips:
      - Heavy weight is key, but only with control.
      - Do not roll the shoulders — vertical path only.
      - Add a pause at the top for maximum trap engagement.
