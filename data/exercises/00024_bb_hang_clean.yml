    description: |
      The hang clean cuts the dead weight — you’re starting with the bar already moving. This variation sharpens your second pull, timing, and turnover speed. It’s pure hip-driven violence. Great for athletes chasing speed, lifters wanting clean refinement, or anyone who needs more explosion in their life. Pull with conviction, or get stapled.
    summary: |
      The barbell hang clean starts from the hang position (above the knees) and is an explosive lift to rack the bar on the shoulders, caught in a partial or full squat.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Stand with the bar at mid-thigh. Hands just outside shoulders, hook grip on.
      2. Brace: Chest up, back tight, slight knee bend.
      3. Hinge: Push hips back slightly to load the hamstrings.
      4. Explode: Extend hips, knees, ankles in one violent snap. Shrug and pull.
      5. Turnover: Pull yourself under the bar — whip elbows through fast.
      6. Catch: Receive bar on shoulders in quarter or full squat.
      7. Stand: Stand tall to finish the rep.
    tips:
      - Don’t rush the pull. Stay over the bar long enough before exploding.
      - Keep the bar close — if it drifts, you’re losing power.
      - Use straps if grip fails during volume work.
