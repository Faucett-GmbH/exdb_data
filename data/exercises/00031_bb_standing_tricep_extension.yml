    description: |
      The barbell standing tricep extension is a raw, overhead assault on the triceps. You press the bar overhead, then control the descent behind your head before firing it back up. It isolates the triceps with a brutal stretch and forces the long head to work overtime. Get sloppy, and you’ll feel it in your back — stay strict, and your arms grow.
    summary: |
      The standing barbell tricep extension trains the triceps by extending the bar overhead from a flexed elbow position, emphasizing the long head of the triceps.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Stand upright, feet shoulder-width, barbell pressed overhead with a narrow grip.
      2. Lower: Bend the elbows to lower the bar behind the head, keeping elbows pointing forward.
      3. Stretch: Lower until the triceps feel fully stretched — just behind the head or neck.
      4. Extend: Extend the elbows to press the bar back to overhead.
      5. Lockout: Finish with arms fully extended.
      6. Repeat: Stay tight throughout.
    tips:
      - If your elbows flare, you’re losing triceps tension.
