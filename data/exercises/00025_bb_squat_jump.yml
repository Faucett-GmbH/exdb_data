    description: |
      The squat jump with a barbell is a raw power movement. You load the bar lightly, dip into a squat, and launch yourself off the ground like you’re escaping Earth’s gravity. It’s simple, violent, and effective. This isn’t a grind — it’s a ballistic attack on slow legs. Controlled landing is essential, or your knees will pay rent to regret.
    summary: |
      The barbell squat jump is an explosive lower-body exercise where you squat and jump vertically with a barbell on your back to develop power and speed.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Barbell on traps, light load. Feet shoulder-width.
      2. Brace: Engage the core. Stay tight.
      3. Descend: Quick, shallow squat — about a quarter to half squat depth.
      4. Explode: Drive through the floor and jump as high as possible.
      5. Land: Land softly, absorbing impact with hips and knees.
      6. Reset: Re-establish tightness and repeat.
    tips:
      - Use at most 20–30% of squat max. It’s for speed, not weight.
      - Don’t let the knees cave in — stay aligned.
      - Do low reps, full rest. Quality > quantity.
