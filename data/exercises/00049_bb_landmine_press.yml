    description: |
      The landmine press is a versatile, joint-friendly press that builds shoulders, upper chest, and core stability. With the barbell anchored on one end, you press the free end upward and slightly forward. It’s perfect for those with cranky shoulders or limited mobility. The angle demands core control to avoid rotation. It’s pressing with a twist — literally.
    summary: |
      The barbell landmine press is a shoulder and upper chest exercise where you press one end of a barbell anchored in a landmine attachment or corner.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Anchor one end of the barbell in a landmine or corner. Grip the free end with one hand near the collar.
      2. Stance: Stand or kneel with feet shoulder-width, torso upright.
      3. Brace: Engage the core, keep shoulders square.
      4. Press: Press the bar upward and slightly forward, fully extending the arm.
      5. Lower: Bring the bar back to the starting position under control.
      6. Repeat: Perform reps on one side, then switch.
    tips:
      - Don’t let the torso twist — resist rotation.
      - Great for overhead pressing if shoulder mobility is limited.
