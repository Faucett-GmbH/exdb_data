    summary: |
      The high bar squat is the foundation of leg strength. Bar sits high on the traps, torso stays upright, knees track forward. Squat deep, drive up hard. This builds quads, glutes, and back strength while reinforcing solid squat mechanics.
    description: |
      The high bar squat is a full-body strength movement that primarily targets the **quadriceps, glutes, and core** while demanding upper back rigidity. With the bar placed high on the traps, the lifter maintains a more **vertical torso**, emphasizing knee flexion and quad engagement. This squat variation is standard for Olympic weightlifters and general strength training due to its full range of motion and carryover to athletic performance.
    instructions: |
      1. **Set the Bar** – Rack the bar at upper chest height. Grip just outside shoulder width, elbows down.  
      2. **Unrack with Control** – Step under the bar, place it on the **upper traps**, not the neck. Stand tall.  
      3. **Brace & Step Back** – Take a deep breath, brace your core, and step back into your stance (just outside shoulder width).  
      4. **Initiate the Descent** – Break at the knees and hips simultaneously, keeping the chest up.  
      5. **Squat Deep** – Lower until your **hip crease is below the knee**, maintaining a vertical torso.  
      6. **Drive Up** – Push through your **midfoot**, drive the bar up, keep the chest tall.  
      7. **Lock Out** – Stand tall at the top, squeeze the glutes, and reset for the next rep.
    tips:
      - Don't let heels or toes lift.
      - Track our knees over toes, not caving inward.
      - Before every rep inhale, expand, and hold tension.
      - Depth matters — parallel isn't enough, get below.
      - Don't let the bar drift forward — keep it balanced over midfoot.
