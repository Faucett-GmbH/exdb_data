    summary: |
      A squat variation where the barbell rests on the front delts, demanding an upright torso and core stability. Builds quads, upper back, and midline strength while reinforcing proper squat mechanics.
    description: |
      The barbell front squat shifts the weight forward, forcing you to maintain a more vertical torso and engage the core harder than in a back squat. It loads the quads, upper back, and abs while demanding mobility in the wrists, shoulders, and ankles. If your elbows drop, you’ll fold like a cheap lawn chair. Mastery of the front squat carries over to Olympic lifts, athletic performance, and brute strength under the bar.
    instructions: |
      1. Rack the Bar: Set the barbell at collarbone height in a squat rack. Approach it and position it across the front of your shoulders, resting on your delts.
      2. Grip the Bar: Use a clean grip (fingers under the bar, elbows high) or cross-arm grip if mobility is lacking. Your upper arms should be parallel to the floor.
      3. Unrack with Intent: Stand up tall, take a controlled step back, and set your stance about shoulder-width apart with toes slightly out.
      4. Brace & Descend: Inhale deep, brace your core like you’re about to take a punch, and squat down by sitting between your legs while keeping your chest up.
      5. Stay Upright: Keep the elbows high and drive the knees out as you descend. If your elbows drop, so will the bar.
      6. Depth & Drive Up: Squat to at least parallel (ideally deeper), then drive through your midfoot, keeping the chest high and standing up strong.
      7. Rack It Back: Step forward into the rack or carefully re-rack the bar once your set is complete.
    tips:
      - If your elbows drop, so will the bar—keep them up!
      - A strong upper back is key. If it collapses, the lift is lost.
      - If wrist mobility is an issue, stretch the wrists or adjust your hand position.
      - Drive your elbows up out of the hole to maintain positioning.
      - Front squats demand a tight core—slack here, and you’ll feel it in your lower back.
