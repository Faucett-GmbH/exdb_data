    description: |
      The glute bridge is the hip thrust’s grounded cousin. Lying on your back, barbell over hips, you drive your hips skyward until the glutes are locked and the core is tight. It isolates the glutes, crushes the hamstrings, and spares the lower back. It’s a simpler setup than the hip thrust — no bench, just you, the bar, and your posterior chain. If your glutes aren’t pumped after these, you did them wrong.
    summary: |
      The barbell glute bridge is a glute-focused exercise where you lift the hips off the ground with a barbell across your hips, targeting glute and hamstring activation.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Lie flat on your back, knees bent, feet flat on the floor hip-width apart. Barbell placed across the hips.
      2. Brace: Core tight, back neutral.
      3. Bridge: Drive through the heels to lift the hips until the body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees.
      4. Squeeze: Contract the glutes hard at the top.
      5. Lower: Control the hips back to the floor.
      6. Repeat: Perform all reps with control and full glute activation.
    tips:
      - Optionally use a bar pad to protect the hips.
      - Focus on glute contraction — not just moving the bar.
      - Don’t overextend the back — keep the ribcage down.
