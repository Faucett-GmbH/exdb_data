    summary: |
      The sumo deadlift is a deadlift variation using a wide stance and narrow grip to shorten the pull, emphasizing the quads, hips, and adductors.
    description: |
      The sumo deadlift is a wide-stance, hips-down approach to moving heavy iron. It's not just a deadlift with your legs spread — it's a unique lift that hammers the hips, adductors, and quads. The bar travels less distance, but demands pristine positioning and serious patience off the floor. It rewards leverage and punishes ego.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Feet wide, toes slightly out. Shins close to the bar. Hands grip narrow, inside the knees.
      2. Brace: Chest up, back tight, hips lower than in conventional deadlift.
      3. Pull: Push the floor apart with your feet. Hips and chest rise together.
      4. Lockout: Stand tall, hips through, shoulders back — no hyperextension.
      5. Descent: Hinge at hips, then bend knees once the bar passes them.
      6. Reset: Get tight again for each rep. Don’t get sloppy.
    tips:
      - Think of spreading the floor apart — not just standing up.
      - Keep shins vertical and back flat.
      - Great for lifters with long torsos or weak hips.
