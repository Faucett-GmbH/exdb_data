      The step-up is where simplicity meets brutality. Load a bar, pick a box, and step up like you’re climbing a mountain with weights on your back. It builds single-leg strength, exposes imbalances, and forces the glutes and quads to do real work. No momentum, no hop — just raw drive through the lead leg. If your balance sucks or your glutes are asleep, this fixes both.
    summary: |
      The barbell step-up is a unilateral leg exercise where you step onto a raised platform with a barbell on your back, targeting quads, glutes, and balance.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Barbell on your traps or rear delts. Stand facing a box or platform at knee height.
      2. Brace: Core tight, chest up.
      3. Step: Plant one foot on the box, push through the heel to drive up.
      4. Top Position: Stand fully on the box — hips and knees extended.
      5. Descent: Step down under control with the same leg or alternate.
      6. Repeat: Complete reps on one side before switching.
    tips:
      - No bouncing — drive through the lead leg only.
      - Keep torso upright to engage the glutes.
      - Start with bodyweight or dumbbells before loading a barbell.
      - Great for athletes needing unilateral strength and stability.
