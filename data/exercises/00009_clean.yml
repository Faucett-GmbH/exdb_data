    summary: |
      A full-body power move. Rip the bar from the floor, launch it to your shoulders, and rack it like you mean it. Explosive, technical, and brutally effective—builds strength, speed, and coordination in one violent pull.
    description: |
      The clean is raw athleticism distilled into a single lift. It takes the bar from the ground to the shoulders in one fluid motion. It’s not a deadlift. It’s not a reverse curl. It’s a leg drive, a hip explosion, and a fast pull into a rock-solid front rack. When done right, it feels effortless. When done wrong, it feels like wrestling a grizzly bear. It builds full-body strength, teaches power transfer, and forges athletes. If you’re slow or sloppy, the bar will expose you.
    instructions: |
      1. Set up with feet under the bar, shoulder-width apart.
      2. Grip the bar just outside the knees, using a hook grip.
      3. Set your back tight, chest up, and hips slightly above the knees.
      4. Drive through the floor, keeping the bar close as it moves up.
      5. Explode—extend the hips and pull fast, shrugging hard at the top.
      6. Drop under the bar, elbows whipping through to catch it in a deep squat.
      7. Stand up strong, keeping the bar racked on the shoulders.
      8. Reset, refine, and repeat. Power is nothing without precision.
    tips:
      - It’s a leg drive, not a bicep curl—pull with the whole body.
      - Fast elbows win—slow elbows mean missed lifts.
      - Bar path is key—keep it tight, no looping forward.
      - Wrist and shoulder mobility matter—fix them if they suck.
      - Master the front squat—if you can’t stand it up, it doesn’t count.
