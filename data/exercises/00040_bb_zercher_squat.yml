    description: |
      The Zercher squat is a test of grit and pain tolerance — bar cradled in your elbows, posture upright, squatting deep. It hits the quads, hammers the core, and challenges your upper back like no other. The load forces tightness and posture or punishes you with discomfort. There’s no faking it — you’re either braced and stable, or you fold like a bad poker hand.
    summary: |
      The barbell Zercher squat loads the bar in the crooks of the elbows, forcing an upright torso and targeting the quads, glutes, core, and upper back.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Load the barbell on a rack around waist height. Hook the bar in the crook of the elbows.
      2. Brace: Stand tall, core tight, chest up.
      3. Descend: Break at hips and knees, squatting down with an upright torso.
      4. Depth: Squat below parallel if mobility allows.
      5. Ascent: Drive through the heels and hips to return upright.
      6. Repeat: Keep elbows high, core braced every rep.
    tips:
      - Use a towel or pad if the bar feels sharp — but don’t soften the challenge too much.
      - Keep the chest up to prevent collapsing forward.
      - Great for building core stability and anterior chain strength.
      - Start light — your biceps will thank you.
