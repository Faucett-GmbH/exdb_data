    description: |
      The split jerk is the king of putting heavy things overhead. You dip, drive, and punch the bar skyward, then split your feet to catch it in a stable lunge position. It’s violent, technical, and unforgiving. This is not just pressing — it’s launching the bar like a missile and diving under it with precision. Every rep is a battle between gravity and your timing.
    summary: |
      The split jerk is an explosive overhead lift where the barbell is driven up and caught overhead in a split stance, maximizing load and stability.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Barbell in front rack. Hands just outside shoulders. Feet hip-width.
      2. Dip: Short, vertical dip — knees bend slightly while torso stays upright.
      3. Drive: Explosively extend hips, knees, and ankles to launch the bar up.
      4. Split: As bar rises, split the legs — front foot forward, back foot back. Punch arms overhead.
      5. Catch: Bar locked out directly over the spine. Hips and shoulders square.
      6. Recover: Front foot back halfway, then back foot forward. Stand fully upright with control.
    tips:
      - Punch the bar through. Don’t just press — accelerate.
      - Split should be balanced: 90-degree angles front and back.
      - Practice footwork separately before loading heavy.
      - The jerk is a skill — warm up with precision before adding plates.
