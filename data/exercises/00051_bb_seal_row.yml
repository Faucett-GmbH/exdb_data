    description: |
      The seal row is the strictest row you’ll ever perform. Lying prone on a bench, the barbell hangs freely underneath — your body stays locked while your lats, rhomboids, and traps do all the pulling. No hip drive, no cheating. Just pure upper back isolation. If your rows turn into total-body convulsions, the seal row exposes your form. Pull hard, pull clean.
    summary: |
      The barbell seal row isolates the upper back by rowing a barbell while lying face down on a flat bench, eliminating body momentum.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Lie face down on a flat bench elevated high enough for the barbell to clear the floor. Bar positioned directly below your shoulders.
      2. Grip: Take a shoulder-width overhand grip on the bar.
      3. Brace: Tighten the core and squeeze the glutes to stabilize.
      4. Row: Pull the bar straight up to touch the underside of the bench.
      5. Squeeze: Hold briefly at the top, squeezing the shoulder blades together.
      6. Lower: Lower the bar under control to a dead stop.
      7. Repeat: Perform controlled reps, resetting each time.
    tips:
      - Keep the head neutral — don’t crank the neck.
      - Use a full range of motion; bar should touch the bench.
      - Straps can help if grip fails before the back fatigues.
