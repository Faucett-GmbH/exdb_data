    summary: |
      A brutal single-leg squat variation with your rear foot elevated and a barbell on your back. Builds legs, hips, and balance—one rep at a time.
    description: |
      The Barbell Bulgarian Split Squat is a unilateral leg exercise that hits your quads, glutes, and hamstrings like a freight train. One foot is planted in front, optionally elevated on a box for a deeper ROM, the other rests on a bench behind you. You squat down on the front leg while keeping the torso upright and balanced. Adding a barbell makes the movement brutally effective—more load, more stability demands, more hypertrophy. It reveals imbalances, strengthens each leg independently, and punishes weaknesses. This is not a show lift. It’s a builder.
    instructions: |
      1. Place a flat bench behind you, roughly knee height.
      2. Load a barbell on your back as you would for a back squat. Use a squat rack.
      3. Step forward with one leg so that your stance is long but stable.
      4. Place the top of your rear foot on the bench behind you.
      5. Brace your core and keep your chest up.
      6. Lower your body by bending the front knee until your thigh is parallel to the ground.
      7. Keep your front foot flat. Don’t let the knee cave in.
      8. Drive through your heel to return to the top.
      9. Perform all reps on one side, then switch legs.
    tips:
      - Start light. This isn’t a back squat—balance comes first.
      - Keep a vertical torso for quad-dominant, lean forward for glute emphasis.
      - Use safety pins or a spotter when going heavy.
      - Your ego doesn't matter here. Clean reps build legs. Wobbly reps build nothing.
