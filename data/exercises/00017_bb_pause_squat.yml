    summary: |
      A squat variation where you pause at the bottom position to build strength, control, and eliminate the stretch reflex — exposing weak points and forging mental grit.
    description: |
      The barbell pause squat is a truth serum. You drop into the hole, stop dead, and hold. No bounce, no help — just you, gravity, and silence. It builds bottom-end strength, forces tightness, and punishes sloppy mechanics. It’s the lift that reveals whether you own your squat or just survive it. Useful for lifters who collapse in the bottom or need better control.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Barbell on your traps or rear delts. Feet shoulder-width. Brace hard.
      2. Descend: Break at hips and knees. Drop to full depth with control.
      3. Pause: Stop dead at the bottom — thighs below parallel. Hold for 1–3 seconds.
      4. Tension: Stay tight. Don’t relax in the hole. Keep your chest up and knees out.
      5. Ascent: Drive hard out of the hole — no rebound. Stand tall.
      6. Reset: Breathe. Brace again. Repeat.
    tips:
      - No bouncing. If you bounce, you’re not pausing.
      - Don’t relax in the bottom. It’s not a vacation. It’s isometric warfare.
      - Excellent for building confidence under heavy weight and cleaning up technique.
