    summary: |
      A compound back exercise where you row the barbell to your torso from a hinged, bent-over position, training the lats, traps, and spinal erectors.
    description: |
      The barbell bent-over row is brutal and beautiful. It builds a thick back, steel traps, and a grip like a vise. You hinge at the hips, set your spine, and row the bar with controlled power up to your belly button. It’s a foundational pulling movement and a forgotten cousin of the deadlift. If you cheat it, you’ll get nothing. If you own it, you’ll grow.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Stand with feet hip-width, grip the barbell just outside your knees, overhand or underhand.
      2. Hinge: Bend at the hips, slight knee bend. Torso nearly parallel to the ground. Back locked in.
      3. Start Position: Bar hanging just below the knees. Arms extended. Shoulders packed.
      4. Pull: Row the bar to the lower ribs or upper abs. Elbows drive back and up.
      5. Lower: Lower the bar under control to full extension. Repeat.
    tips:
      - Strict form first. Cheat rows are earned, not default.
      - Keep your torso still and avoid excessive jerking.
      - Use straps if grip fails before the back.
