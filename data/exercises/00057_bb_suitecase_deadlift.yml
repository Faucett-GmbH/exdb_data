    description: |
      The suitcase deadlift looks simple — pick up a barbell from the side — but it’s a battle against rotation. Like carrying a heavy suitcase through the airport, this lift crushes your grip, lights up the obliques, and punishes any asymmetry. It’s one of the best anti-rotation drills you can load heavy. If your core folds or your spine twists, the bar tells on you.
    summary: |
      The barbell suitcase deadlift is a unilateral lift where you deadlift a barbell from one side, building grip, core, and anti-rotation strength.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Place a loaded barbell at your side. Feet hip-width, bar at midfoot.
      2. Grip: Reach down and grip the bar with one hand, arm straight.
      3. Brace: Engage the core, shoulders square, back flat.
      4. Pull: Stand up by pushing through the floor, keeping the torso upright.
      5. Lockout: Stand tall, shoulders level, bar at your side.
      6. Lower: Control the descent back to the floor.
      7. Repeat: Finish reps, then switch sides.
    tips:
      - Don’t let the bar pull you sideways — stay square.
      - Start light — it’s harder than it looks.
      - Great for farmers, fighters, and anyone who wants real-world strength.
      - Strap optional — but grip strength is part of the test.
