    summary: |
      The barbell push press uses leg drive to propel the barbell overhead, combining lower body power with upper body pressing strength.
    description: |
      The push press is the bridge between raw press strength and explosive power. You dip, drive, and punch the bar overhead with authority. It’s not a strict press — it’s a violence-assisted press. Useful for lifters needing to overload the press, build shoulder and tricep power, and translate leg force into upper body action. If it’s slow, you’re doing it wrong.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Barbell on front rack. Hands just outside shoulders. Elbows slightly forward.
      2. Brace: Full body tight. Core locked down.
      3. Dip: Quick, controlled dip by bending knees and hips slightly — torso vertical.
      4. Drive: Explosively extend knees and hips to launch the bar upward.
      5. Press: As bar clears the head, press it to full arm extension overhead.
      6. Catch and Reset: Control the bar back to the rack. Repeat.
    tips:
      - It’s not a squat. The dip is short and sharp.
      - Bar path stays vertical. No looping the bar forward.
      - Use heavier loads than strict press, but don’t turn it into a jerk.
