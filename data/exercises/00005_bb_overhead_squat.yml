    description: |
      The barbell overhead squat is an advanced squat variation that requires strength, mobility, and coordination. With the bar held in a wide snatch grip overhead, the lifter descends into a deep squat while keeping the bar stabilized. This movement challenges the shoulders, core, and legs, demanding balance and flexibility. It exposes weaknesses and improves control, making it a staple for weightlifters and athletes needing full-body strength.
    instructions: |
      1. Grip the bar with a snatch-width grip and press it overhead, locking out your elbows.
      2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your toes slightly turned out.
      3. Brace your core and begin the squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees.
      4. Keep your chest up and the bar in line with your midfoot.
      5. Descend until your hips are below parallel, maintaining a tight, controlled position.
      6. Drive back up through your heels, keeping the bar stable and arms locked.
      7. Stand tall at the top, resetting before the next rep.
    tips:
      - If the bar drifts forward, your squat mechanics or shoulder mobility needs work.
      - Actively press the bar upward throughout the lift.
      - Start with an empty bar or PVC pipe to dial in technique.
      - Engage your lats to stabilize the bar—don’t just rely on passive overhead positioning.
      - If you can't squat to depth, work on ankle, hip, and thoracic mobility.
