    description: |
      The barbell hack squat flips the deadlift on its head. With the bar behind you, the movement hammers the quads while still loading the glutes and hamstrings. It’s awkward, old-school, and effective. This is the barbell version of a machine hack squat — minus the comfort. Pull it clean, stay upright, and your quads will hate you for days.
    summary: |
      The barbell hack squat is a quad-dominant deadlift variation where the barbell is held behind the legs and pulled from the floor to a standing position.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Barbell behind your legs, feet hip-width, hands gripping bar just outside hips.
      2. Brace: Chest up, back flat, core tight.
      3. Pull: Stand up by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright.
      4. Lockout: Finish tall with hips through and knees extended.
      5. Lower: Lower the bar under control to the floor.
      6. Repeat: Maintain tight form every rep.
    tips:
      - Keep the bar close to the body — let it graze the hamstrings.
      - Heels flat — any heel lift ruins quad engagement.
      - Start light; the bar path feels weird until you learn it well.
