    summary: |
      The hang snatch is an Olympic lift variation where the bar starts above the floor (typically at the thigh) and is explosively lifted overhead and caught in a partial squat.
    description: |
      The hang snatch strips the movement down to its essence — power and precision. Taken from above the knees, it removes the first pull and emphasizes violent hip extension and fast turnover. It teaches you to stay over the bar, finish your pull, and commit to the catch. When done right, it’s poetry in motion. When done wrong, it’s a fast track to a missed lift or worse.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Stand with the bar at mid-thigh. Use a snatch-width hook grip. Chest up, back tight, shoulders slightly in front of the bar.
      2. Dip: Slight bend at the knees, push hips back — this is not a squat.
      3. Explode: Extend the hips, knees, and ankles hard. Shrug and pull yourself under the bar.
      4. Turnover: Elbows high, then fast down and around. Punch the bar overhead.
      5. Catch: Receive the bar in a partial squat with locked elbows.
      6. Stand: Recover to standing under control.
    tips:
      - Focus on bar speed and proximity — it should brush the thighs.
      - Don’t cut the extension short. Finish the hips before diving under.
      - Great for teaching beginners the timing of the second pull.
      - Use light-to-moderate weight to groove mechanics. It's a power primer, not a grinder.
