    summary: |
      The Barbell Bench Press is a compound upper-body exercise that primarily targets the chest, while also working the shoulders and triceps. It's a cornerstone movement for building pressing strength and muscle mass in the upper body.
    description: |
      The Barbell Bench Press is the king of upper-body pushing exercises. Lying flat on a bench, you press a barbell from your chest to full arm extension, engaging the pectorals, deltoids, and triceps. It's an essential lift for anyone aiming to build a strong, muscular chest and improve pressing power. Whether you're training for strength, size, or overall upper-body development, the bench press is a must.
    instructions: |
      1. **Set Up**: Lie on a flat bench with your eyes directly under the barbell. Plant your feet firmly on the ground and grip the barbell with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
      2. **Unrack the Bar**: Press the barbell up, locking your elbows, and move the bar over your shoulders. Keep your shoulder blades pinched together and your chest lifted.
      3. **Lower the Bar**: With control, lower the barbell to your mid-chest, keeping your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your torso. Donâ€™t let the bar bounce off your chest.
      4. **Press the Bar Up**: Drive the barbell back up to full arm extension by pressing through your chest and triceps. Keep your back tight and feet planted throughout.
      5. **Repeat**: Perform for the desired reps, maintaining control and form. Rack the bar when done.
    tips:
      - Focus on keeping the movement controlled avoiding bouncing the bar or arching excessively.
      - Keep your body tight, chest up, and press with intention to engage the target muscles efficiently.
