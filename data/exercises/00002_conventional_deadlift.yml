    summary: |
      The deadlift is the ultimate test of raw strength—pick up a heavy barbell from the floor and stand up. It builds posterior chain power, grip, and total-body strength. Set up properly, brace hard, and drive through the legs. The bar moves when you do everything right.
    description: |
      The conventional deadlift is simple: lift the heaviest weight you can from the floor to a standing position. It’s also brutally effective. It hammers your hamstrings, glutes, back, and grip, making it the foundation of strength training. The key is efficiency—tight setup, controlled pull, and full lockout. Grip it, brace, and drive. Don’t let your ego override your form—bad pulls lead to bad backs.
    instructions: |
      1. Set Your Feet – Stand with feet hip-width apart, bar over midfoot. Toes slightly out.
      2. Grip the Bar – Hands just outside knees, double-overhand or mixed grip.
      3. Set Your Back – Chest up, lats tight, spine neutral. Hips higher than a squat, but not too high.
      4. Brace & Pull Slack Out – Deep breath, squeeze the bar, feel the tension before pulling.
      5. Drive with Legs – Push through your heels, keep the bar close, extend hips and knees together.
      6. Lock Out Strong – Stand tall, squeeze glutes, keep shoulders back.
      7. Lower with Control – Hips go back first, then bend knees, guiding the bar down.
    tips:
      - Bar over midfoot—too far forward, and you’ll fight against leverage.
      - Hips in the right spot—too low, and it’s a squat; too high, and you lose power.
      - Stay tight—slack in the bar means slack in your body.
      - Pull in a straight line—bar should drag up your shins, not loop forward.
      - Don't jerk it—build tension first, then drive.
