    summary: |
      A unilateral leg exercise that builds strength, balance, and coordination. Load a barbell on your back, step forward, lower under control, and drive back up. It hammers the quads, glutes, and hamstrings while exposing any weakness between legs.
    description: |
      The barbell lunge is a brutal but effective leg builder. It forces each leg to work independently, fixing imbalances and demanding coordination. Unlike squats, there’s no hiding a weak side. Load a barbell on your upper back, step forward, and sink into a lunge, keeping your torso upright. Then drive through the front foot to return to standing. Rinse and repeat. Your legs will thank you later—or maybe not.
    instructions: |
      1. Set a barbell on a squat rack at shoulder height.
      2. Step under it, position it across your upper back, and grip it slightly wider than shoulder-width.
      3. Unrack the bar and step back. Stand tall with feet hip-width apart.
      4. Step forward with one leg, landing on the heel first.
      5. Lower your back knee toward the floor until your front thigh is parallel to the ground.
      6. Drive through the heel of your front foot to push back to the starting position.
      7. Repeat with the other leg, alternating for reps.
    tips:
      - Keep the torso upright—don’t fold forward.
      - Drive through the front foot, not the toes.
      - A longer step shifts emphasis to glutes, a shorter step keeps it quad-dominant.
      - Start light—imbalances will humble you quickly.
      - If you wobble like a baby deer, go back to split squats and build stability first.
