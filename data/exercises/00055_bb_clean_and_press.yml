    description: |
      The clean and press is the working man’s Olympic lift — less finesse, more fight. You rip the bar from the floor to the shoulders with a clean, then drive it overhead with a press. It’s raw, it’s brutal, and it hits everything — legs, hips, back, shoulders, arms, lungs. There’s no hiding in this lift. If you want to get strong, move fast, and look like you lift, this is your tool.
    summary: |
      The barbell clean and press is a full-body lift combining a powerful clean to the shoulders with an overhead press, building strength, explosiveness, and conditioning.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Feet hip-width, grip just outside the legs, bar over midfoot.
      2. Clean: Pull the bar from the floor, extend hips and knees explosively, shrug, and rack the bar on your shoulders.
      3. Reset: Stand tall, brace the core.
      4. Press: Strict press the bar overhead to lockout.
      5. Lockout: Bar over the crown of the head, arms extended.
      6. Lower: Drop the bar to the floor.
      7. Repeat: Keep every rep sharp — no slop.
    tips:
      - Don’t jerk the bar off the floor — stay tight and deliberate.
      - If your press is weak, work strict presses separately.
      - Use bumpers and a platform — dropping is expected.
      - Can be done strict, or with a push press for more weight.
