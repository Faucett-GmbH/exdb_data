    summary: |
      The standing barbell overhead press is the king of upper body strength. It builds pressing power, shoulder stability, and full-body coordination. No bench, no support—just you, the bar, and gravity. If you can press heavy standing, you're strong.
    description: |
      The standing barbell overhead press is a fundamental lift for developing upper-body strength, particularly in the shoulders, triceps, and upper chest. Unlike seated presses, it demands balance, core stability, and full-body engagement. The movement starts with the bar at shoulder height and ends with the bar locked out overhead. It's simple but brutally effective—an honest test of pressing strength.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, barbell racked at shoulder height in front, hands just outside shoulder width. Elbows slightly forward.
      2. Bracing: Squeeze your glutes, tighten your abs, and keep your chest up. The entire body must be tight.
      3. Press: Drive the bar straight up, pushing your head through as it clears your forehead. Keep your forearms vertical.
      4. Lockout: Fully extend your elbows, shrug your shoulders slightly at the top. The bar should be in line with your ears.
      5. Lower: Control the descent, bringing the bar back to the starting position. Reset, breathe, and press again.
    tips:
      - Tight glutes, tight abs—if your core is loose, you’ll leak power and risk injury.
      - Press in a straight line—not around your face. Pull your chin back as the bar moves up.
      - Grip matters—too wide, and you lose power; too narrow, and you stress the wrists.
      - Legs don’t help—this isn’t a push press. Keep your knees locked.
      - Progress with microloading—small jumps keep the lift moving up.
      - Do not lean back-keep the upper pectorals out of this movement.
