    summary: |
      A vertical press performed seated with a barbell. Builds shoulder strength, upper chest, and triceps while limiting lower-body involvement.
    description: |
      The Barbell Seated Overhead Press isolates upper-body pressing power. With hips anchored and lower-body drive removed, your shoulders, upper chest, and triceps do the work. A strict test of raw pressing strength. The bar travels from clavicle to overhead in a straight line. No leg help, no back arching, no excuses. If the standing press is a test of full-body power, the seated version is pure upper-body punishment.
    instructions: |
      1. Sit on a bench with an upright back support inside a power rack.
      2. Set the barbell at shoulder height and load appropriately.
      3. Grip the bar just outside shoulder-width. Feet flat on the ground.
      4. Unrack the bar and hold it at clavicle level with wrists stacked over elbows.
      5. Brace your core and press the bar straight up until arms lock overhead.
      6. Lower the bar under control to your upper chest.
      7. Keep your torso vertical—no leaning back or shrugging.
      8. Repeat for reps. Rack with control.
    tips:
      - Keep your glutes and abs tight. Don’t let your lower back arch.
      - Use a false (thumbless) grip only if experienced.
      - Lock out hard—don’t short the top.
