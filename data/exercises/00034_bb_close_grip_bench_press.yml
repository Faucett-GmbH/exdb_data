    description: |
      The close-grip bench press is a pressing movement for people who need stronger triceps and don’t want to mess around. By narrowing your grip, you shift the load away from the pecs and put it squarely on the triceps. This is a heavy, compound builder that carries over directly to your pressing strength. Done right, it’s a triceps dominator — done wrong, it’s a shoulder killer. Grip it tight, press it hard.
    summary: |
      The barbell close-grip bench press targets the triceps while still engaging the chest and shoulders, using a narrower hand position than the traditional bench press.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Lie on a flat bench. Grip the bar around shoulder-width.
      2. Unrack: Lift the bar and hold it above your lower chest.
      3. Lower: Bring the bar down to the sternum or lower chest. Keep elbows close to the body.
      4. Press: Drive the bar back up, extending the elbows fully.
      5. Lockout: Squeeze the triceps hard at the top.
      6. Repeat: Control each rep.
    tips:
      - Don’t go too narrow — wrists shouldn’t be jammed together.
      - Keep elbows tucked — flaring ruins the triceps focus.
      - Perfect as an accessory for improving the bench press lockout.
      - Start lighter than your regular bench press — the movement is stricter.
