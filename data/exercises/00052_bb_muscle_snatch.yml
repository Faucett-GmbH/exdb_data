    description: |
      The muscle snatch strips the snatch down to its essentials — one fluid pull, no dropping under. It’s all about extension, speed, and bar path. From the floor to overhead in one go, you finish tall and aggressive. It sharpens turnover mechanics, builds overhead strength, and punishes sloppy technique. No catch, no squat — just a punchy pull to finish.
    summary: |
      The barbell muscle snatch is an explosive pull from the floor to overhead without rebending the knees, emphasizing upper-body drive and turnover speed.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Start like a snatch — feet hip-width, hook grip, snatch-width hand placement.
      2. Pull: Push through the floor, extend hips, knees, and ankles in one explosive motion.
      3. High Pull: Continue pulling the bar high, elbows above the bar.
      4. Turnover: As the bar passes the face, punch it overhead without rebending the knees or hips.
      5. Lockout: Finish standing tall, bar overhead, arms locked.
      6. Lower: Control the bar back to the floor or shoulders.
    tips:
      - No rebend — that’s the key difference from a full snatch.
      - Keep the bar close — looping it forward kills momentum.
      - Great for reinforcing bar path and building aggressive turnover.
