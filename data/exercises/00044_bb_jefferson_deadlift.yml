    description: |
      The Jefferson deadlift is the oddball of the deadlift family. One foot forward, one back, bar between the legs — and you pull. It’s ugly, unconventional, but brutally effective for building rotational strength, leg drive, and uncovering weak links. If your training is too symmetrical and your progress stalled, the Jefferson deadlift will humble and rebuild you. Every rep feels like a fight — because it is.
    summary: |
      The Jefferson deadlift is a unique deadlift variation where you straddle the barbell, pulling it between your legs to build strength, balance, and address asymmetries.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Straddle the barbell with one foot in front, one behind. Feet shoulder-width or wider.
      2. Grip: One hand in front, one behind (mixed grip around the bar’s ends).
      3. Brace: Chest up, back tight, core engaged.
      4. Pull: Drive through both legs, standing tall while keeping the bar balanced between the legs.
      5. Lockout: Finish fully extended — hips through, chest proud.
      6. Lower: Control the descent, reset each rep.
      7. Alternate Stance: Switch leg positions between sets.
    tips:
      - Keep the bar close to your center of mass.
      - Great for core, grip, and addressing left-right imbalances.
      - Start light — this lift taxes coordination as much as strength.
      - Stand square at the top — don’t twist.
