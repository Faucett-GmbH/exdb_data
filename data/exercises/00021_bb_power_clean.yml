    summary: |
      The power clean is an explosive lift that pulls the barbell from the floor and catches it on the shoulders in a partial squat, building total-body power.
    description: |
      The power clean is the godfather of explosive strength. You rip the bar from the floor, explode through the hips, and catch it high — like stealing weight from gravity. It’s not for the slow or the soft. If the bar isn’t moving fast, you’re not power cleaning. It builds speed, coordination, and brutal strength in one unapologetic movement.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Feet hip-width, grip just outside shoulders. Chest up, back tight, shoulders over bar.
      2. First Pull: Push through the floor. Bar rises slow and steady past the knees.
      3. Transition: Knees re-bend slightly, hips shift forward under the bar.
      4. Second Pull: Explode! Hips, knees, and ankles extend violently. Shrug hard.
      5. Pull Under: Elbows whip around FAST. Drop into a quarter squat.
      6. Catch: Receive the bar on the shoulders, elbows high, torso upright.
      7. Stand: Stand tall, stabilize, then reset.
    tips:
      - Finish the pull. If your hips don’t extend, you’re deadlifting, not cleaning.
      - Elbows drive through, not just up. Snap them around like your life depends on it.
      - Use heavier loads than strict press, but don’t turn it into a jerk.
