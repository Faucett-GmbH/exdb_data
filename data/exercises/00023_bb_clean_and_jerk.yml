    description: |
      The clean and jerk is the king of all lifts. It’s two lifts stitched into one brutal, beautiful display of strength and speed. You haul the bar to your shoulders with the clean, then blast it overhead with the jerk. No part of your body is spared — legs, back, shoulders, lungs, pride. It’s the ultimate test of power, precision, and grit. No half measures.
    summary: |
      The clean and jerk is a two-part Olympic lift: clean the bar to the shoulders, then jerk it overhead. It builds total-body power, strength, and coordination.
    instructions: |
      1. Clean Phase:
        * Setup: Bar over midfoot. Hands just outside shoulders. Chest up, back tight.
        * First Pull: Drive through the floor, bar passes knees.
        * Transition: Hips forward, knees re-bend under bar.
        * Second Pull: Explode — hips, knees, and ankles extend.
        * Pull Under: Elbows whip around, catch in front rack squat.
        * Stand: Stand tall from the squat.
      2. Jerk Phase:
        * Dip: Short, vertical knee and hip bend.
        * Drive: Explosively drive up.
        * Split or Power Jerk: Punch the bar overhead. Feet split (or stay flat for power jerk).
        * Recover: Stabilize and bring feet back together.
    tips:
      - Fast elbows in the clean, fast feet in the jerk.
      - Control the front rack in the clean — sloppy rack kills the jerk.
      - Train both split and power jerks to develop versatility.
      - Treat it like two lifts, but don’t stop between them — flow matters.
