    description: |
      The Pendlay row is a no-cheat, brute-strength builder. Unlike the regular bent-over row, every rep starts dead from the floor. Hips back, back parallel to the ground, you explosively pull the bar to your chest, then reset. No momentum, no bouncing — just raw pulling power. It builds the lats, traps, and erectors, and carries over directly to your deadlift and Olympic lifts.
    summary: |
      The barbell Pendlay row is a strict back exercise where you row the bar from the floor to the torso, emphasizing power, lats, and upper back strength.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Stand with feet hip-width. Hinge at the hips until torso is parallel to the ground. Grip the bar just outside the knees.
      2. Brace: Core tight, back flat, bar over midfoot.
      3. Row: Explosively pull the bar to the lower chest or upper abs, elbows driving back.
      4. Lower: Return the bar to the floor with control — full stop.
      5. Reset: Re-brace for each rep; don’t bounce.
      6. Repeat: Perform for strict, powerful reps.
    tips:
      - Keep back parallel to the ground — no rising up.
      - Reset each rep — this isn’t a bent-over row.
