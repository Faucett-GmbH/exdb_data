    summary: |
      A barbell pressing movement done on an incline bench. Emphasizes upper chest and shoulders. Builds pressing strength with precision.
    description: |
      The Incline Barbell Bench Press targets the upper pectorals, front delts, and triceps. The incline angle shifts emphasis from the mid-chest to the clavicular head of the pectorals. It’s a key builder for upper-body mass and pressing power. By adjusting the bench to a 30–45° angle and pressing the barbell from the upper chest, you develop real-world strength and size. It’s not a flat bench—don’t treat it like one. Controlled descent, powerful drive. No ego lifting.
    instructions: |
      1. Set a bench to a 30–45° incline inside a power rack.
      2. Load the barbell and lie back with feet flat on the floor.
      3. Grip the bar just outside shoulder width.
      4. Unrack the bar and hold it over your upper chest.
      5. Lower the bar in a controlled path to just below the collarbone.
      6. Keep wrists straight, elbows slightly tucked—not flared.
      7. Drive the bar upward, pressing through the palms until arms are locked out.
      8. Reset and repeat for desired reps. Rack with control.
    tips:
      - Elbows should track under the bar, not wing out wide.
      - Pinch your shoulder blades and keep your back tight.
