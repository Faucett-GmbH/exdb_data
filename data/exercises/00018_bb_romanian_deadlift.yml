    summary: |
      The Romanian deadlift is a hip-hinge movement that targets the hamstrings, glutes, and posterior chain using a controlled eccentric and minimal knee bend.
    description: |
      The RDL is the hinge that humbles lifters. It punishes ego and rewards control. With soft knees and a locked-in back, you push the hips back until the hamstrings scream. Then you stand tall — like nothing happened. This lift isn’t about yanking big plates. It’s about building the back-end engine that powers everything from the clean to the jump.
    instructions: |
      1. Setup: Stand with feet hip-width, bar in hands with overhand or mixed grip. Start from the top.
      2. Brace: Squeeze the lats. Lock the back. Slight bend in the knees.
      3. Hinge: Push hips back. Let the bar slide down your thighs. Keep it close.
      4. Descent: Lower until you feel a strong hamstring stretch — usually just below the knees.
      5. Stop: Don’t let your spine round. Range of motion ends where tightness begins.
      6. Ascent: Drive hips forward and stand tall. Don’t let knees shoot forward.
    tips:
      - This is not a squat. Hips go back, not down.
      - Control the eccentric.
      - Use straps if grip limits load.
